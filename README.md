## Yacht

Yacht is a container management UI with a focus on templates and 1-click deployments.

This version has been simplified to run entirely under Python 3.11 without a separate Node-based frontend.

## Installation:

Installation instructions can be found here: https://wickedyoda.com/?p=3088

Currently only linux has been verified as working but we are open to the idea of supporting windows eventually as well.

**Keep in mind, this is an alpha so the risk of data loss is real and it may not be stable**


## Features So Far:

* Vuetify UI Framework
* Basic Container Management
* Template Framework
* Easy Template Updating
* Centralized settings for volume management and similar QOL functionality.
* Docker-Compose Compatibility
* Advanced Container Management (Edit/Modify)

## Planned Features:

* Container Monitoring
* Easy access to container interfaces
* User Management
* Scheduled Jobs

*If you want something that's not planned please open a feature request issue and we'll see about getting it added.*

## Templating:

Currently Yacht is compatible with portainer templates. You'll add a template url in the "Add Template" settings. The the template will be read, separated into apps, and imported into the database. The apps associated with the templates are linked via a db relationship so when the template is removed, so are the apps associated with it. We store the template url as well so we can enable updating templates with a button press.

We recommend starting with:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wickeyoda/selfhosted_templates/yacht/Template/template.json
```

In templates you are able to define variables (starting with `!`) to have them automatically replaced by whatever variable the user has set in their server settings (ie. `!config` will be replaced by `/yacht/AppData/Config` by default).

## Notes for ARM devices

If you're on arm and graphs aren't showing up add the following to your cmdline.txt:

```
cgroup_enable=cpuset cgroup_enable=memory cgroup_memory=1
```

## Supported Environment Variables

You can utilize the following environment variables in Yacht. None of them are mandatory.

| Variable     | Description                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PUID         | Set userid that the container will run as.                                                                                                                                              |
| PGID         | Set groupid that the container will run as.                                                                                                                                             |
| SECRET_KEY   | Setting this to a random string ensures you won't be logged out in between reboots of Yacht.                                                                                            |
| ADMIN_EMAIL  | This sets the email for the default Yacht user.                                                                                                                                         |
| DISABLE_AUTH | This disables authentication on the backend of Yacht. It's not recommended unless you're using something like Authelia to manage authentication.                                        |
| DATABASE_URL | If you want to have Yacht use a database like SQL instead of the built in sqlite on you can put that info here in the following format:`postgresql://user:password@postgresserver/db` |
| COMPOSE_DIR  | This is the path inside the container which contains your folders that have docker compose projects. (*compose tag only*)                                                             |

## Notes for installing Docker and Yacht on WSL2 platform under Windows

If you’re running under WSL2 inside Windows, because of the difference in how permissions are handled. Your essentially inside of a Linux machine accessing a Windows file system. You will need to run after installation before adding the Yacht container:

```
$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Additional information about this can be found in the [Post-installation steps for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)

## Update button not working?

*If the built in update button isn't working for you try the following command:*

```
docker run --rm -d -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock containrrr/watchtower:latest --cleanup --run-once <container-name>
```
